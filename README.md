Use gyroscope and accelerometer to calculate angle.  
  
<b>Embarc Osp used in the source code isn't the latest version. </b>It is pretty different when using peripheral. The latest version is recommended. This repo is just a final project of the course lab. It shows how to calculate sloping angle with simple C language.  
In the final project, LEDs and Pmod LCD are used to visualize sloping angle.
